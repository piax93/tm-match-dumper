# Match Dumper

Super naive [Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/) plugin to dump match times into a CSV file.

Simply pick a filename, and start recording as the match is played.

Every record in the dump has a timestamp, the track name, the player ID, the player username, and the time set in milliseconds.
It can optionally also record round point scores, and checkpoint times.

The files are stored in Openplanet's plugin storage folder, so by default 

```
%UserProfile%\OpenplanetNext\PluginStorage\MatchDumper
```
